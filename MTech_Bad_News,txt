No matter how much i write in exam paper, they will only fail me.
I shared this news to my boyfriend though we are in huge breakup fight.
He told me:- They purposely failed you again like in last semester.
This time, I am not complaining anymore.
Mom was telling that they are jealous of me.
Dad also knows my huge potential.

For project phase-1, 4 students got full marks.
I am the only student in my class who had done own project, but never received full marks.
I wrote all these arrear papers for 2-3 months.
I took heavy pressure and stress, but i managed to complete it.
I wrote all arrears very well.
I was the first student in my class to get paper acceptance twice for international conferences (IEEE & Springer).
I missed IEEE conference since i had arrear exam. Now, Next is Springer in June.
My MTech college will get over in May 1st week.

I work so hard...
Here is a small challenge for me... Ask me any question from MTech subjects i took.. I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
This time, I tried so hard writing well.
Again, i was purposely failed.

My classmates hates me, because i am a GEEK and always finishes before deadline.
Today, i took one day leave since i was heavily sick.
I was threatened by project-incharge that she will cancel my project if i take any leave.
She is the most heartless person i had ever seen...

Then comes... project guide who never guides anything.
I send him regular updates, but he never responds.

My whole MTech life smashed me... And junior laugh at me because i have scary appearance.
I feel so broken by my results.

There is no revaluation too. Only re-totalling, which is waste to apply.
My college is NOT safe for good girls at all.
I am doing masters with a goal.

Professors never understand students. They award high marks for pet students who have no goals or ambitions.
Tomorrow, Which company will recruit me?
No recruiter will not understand any candidate's feelings, they want best candidates and these enemies are smashing my future.

I am really dying to work...
I love learning, but i hate blind-memorizing.

Guess what? I must spend next few months writing arrears.
What to do? Big companies prefer candidates with masters degree.

I am good in designing architectures and workflow.
I am good in computer networking.
I am good in programming (not-expert).
I am good in understanding concepts.
A quick learner.

Do i really deserve this?
