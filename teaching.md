We all need money...

Money is survival..

But, i will never ever become a professor for few reasons,

(i) In whole academics, 
Students laugh/poke fun/scream of my scary appearance/weird walking. 
I experienced it several times.
I never fight with them because they are not equal to my anger.
I don't want to work in such a place.

(ii) I am too obsessed and learn too deeper taking so long,
Teaching is a profession where he/she need to finish taking classes within deadlines.
My learning methodology fails in deadline. 
Because I keep on learning and see if i could try it in practical.
I never fail in completing tasks within deadline.
When it comes to learning, i fail because i couldn't stay limited.
So, this is another reason.

(iii) Teachers need to remember every concept from the books.
For me, My memory extract the specific information in a deeper way.
Which is also why some people put me in a category called "different",
that made me feel like an alien staying alone always.

(iv) I don't like teachers.
There was a time (till 2006), i love teachers.
Then, time changed!

(v) Teachers are heavily partially, political & gossipers equivalent to some students.
I am never partial and i don't do politics.

(vi) I want to stay as ME.

Lastly, i don't want to spoil someone's life like how my life had turned out.

There are alternatives to earn money.

Everyone will be good at something.
