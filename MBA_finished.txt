I did my MBA through distance education in another university.
One advantage of studying in that university is that "externals read the paper properly and evaluate it".
I am 100% sure that externals must have passed me on reading my "case studies" because i am practically skilled.
MBA gave me both business as well as systems management exposure.
Now, MBA degree is finished.
