(d) Review the statement of scope
(e) Modify the statement of scope
```
```
1.5 The Project
-- 5 approaches
(a) Start on the right foot
(b) Maintain momentum
(c) Track progress
(d) Make smart devices
(e) Conduct postmortem analysis
```

Additional Reading:
An excellent paper on software processes and projects from Barry Boehm

"The W5HH Principle"

Why was the system being developed?
What will be done?
When will it be done?
Who is responsible for a function?
Where are they located organizationally?
How will the job be done both technically and mangerially?
How much of each resource is needed?
