Software Estimation

(referring material: Software Project Estimation)
```
```
Options available for software estimation:
1. Delay estimation
2. Base estimation
3. Using Simple decomposition techniques
4. Using Empirical estimation Models
```
```
Delay Estimation
- Cost estimation

Base estimation
- Examples:
(a) Customers
(b) Business conditions
(c) Software engineering environment
(d) Deadlines

Using simple decomposition techniques
- Divide and conquer approach

Using empirical estimation model
- based upon historical data and provides a valuable estimation approach.
