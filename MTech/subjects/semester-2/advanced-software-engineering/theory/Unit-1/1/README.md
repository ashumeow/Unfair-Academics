Waterfall model:
1. Communication
1.1 Project initiation
1.2 Requirements gathering
2. Planning
2.1 Estimating
2.2 Scheduling
2.3 Tracking
3. Modelling
3.1 Analysis
3.2 Design
4. Construction
4.1 Code
4.2 Test
5. Deployment
5.1 Delivery
5.2 Support
5.3 Feedback

V-model

Requirements gathering ----- Acceptance Testing
Architectural Design ------- System Testing
Component Design ----------- Integration Testing
Code Deployment ------------ Unit Testing

As every step gets executed, 
every testing process checks previous step before executing current step.
```
```
Incremental model:

Communication -> planning -> modelling -> construction -> Deployment

This process is done by increment #1, increment #2... increment #n in a bottom-top axis plot.
```
```
Evolutionary process model:

--- Communication
--- Quick plan
--- Modelling quick design
--- Constructing a prototype
--- Deployment, Delivery, Feedback
```
```
A final word on evolutionary processes
-- Prototyping
-- Evolutionary software processes
-- Software processes
```
