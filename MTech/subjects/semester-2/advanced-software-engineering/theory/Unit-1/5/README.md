Planning risk analysis
```
```
1. Software risks

1.1 Definition -- Keywords
(a) uncertainity
(b) risks

1.2 Types
1.2.1 Project risks
1.2.2 Technical risks
1.2.3 Business risks
1.2.4 Predictable risks
```
```
2. Risk identification

Risk types
-- Generic risks
-- Product specific risks

Risk identification through following sub-categories:
(a) Product size
(b) Business impact
(c) Stakeholder's characteristics
(d) Process definition
(e) Development Environment
(f) Technologies to be built
(g) Staff size and experience

2.1 Asessing overall project risk

2.2 Risk components and drivers

2.2.1 Risk components
2.2.1.1 Performance risks
2.2.1.2 Cost risks
2.2.1.3 Support risks
2.2.1.4 Schedule risks

2.2.2 Risk Drivers
2.2.2.1 Negligible
2.2.2.2 Marginal
2.2.2.3 Critical
2.2.2.4 Catastrophic
```

3. Risk projection
-- otherwise known as risk estimation.

Four risk projection steps:
(a) Establish a scale.
(b) Indicate the exact consequences of the risk.
(c) Estimate the impact of the risks on the project and product.
(d) Assess the overall accuracy of the risk projection.

Plotting:
Risk components on X-axis and Risk drivers on Y-axis

3.1 Developing a risk table

3.2 Assessing risk impact

3.2.1 Steps to determine the risk:
a -- Determining the average probability of occurences for each risk
b -- Determining the impact for each component
c -- Complete the risk table and Analyze the results

3.2.2 Defining the project risks
(a) Risk identification
(b) Risk probability
(c) Risk impact
(d) Risk Exposure (RE)
RE = P X C
where,
P => Probability of occurences for the risk
C => Cost to the project
```
```
4. Risk refinement
-- Easier to mitigate, monitor and manage.
-- Representation of risks
condition -> transition -> consequence
```
```
5. Risk Mitigation, Monitoring and Management

Possible steps:
(i) Meet with current staff members to determine the causes.
(ii) Migitate those causes.
(iii) Once project commences, then turnover will occur and develop techniques to ensure continuity.
(iv) Organize the project team.
(v) Define work product standards and establish the mechanisms.
(vi) Conduct a peer review.
(vii) Assign a backup staff member.
