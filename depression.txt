If i write this in twitter, then some assholes will say to control emotions...
It's easy for asshole to say such words because they never faced such things in life..
Since last thursday, i was really sad..
So, i kept my project documentation aside for some days and i was learning/doing some new things.
Today (Monday), i bunked college due to heavy sadness.. 
I really wrote my papers well.. And Why do these heartless professors always fail me?
Hard to even visualize my future itself..
If i could get job and earn money, then i can buy expensive gadgets or some nice electronics while "exploring".
Or maybe, i can buy more veggies... or maybe, i donate some to charity or funds... Or maybe, i can travel a lot...
Or maybe, i can... hmmm...
With my stupid brain thinking... i wanna try explore more and contribute more to technology..
i love technology...
Technology is my drug...
Everything is related like genes...
If i ever meet a creator of any technology, then i would ask him/her that "What influenced them to build such innovation?"
And "What did they related to while doing it?" I wonder whether they had any connection (in mind).
Because i always connect to dots... Connecting is fun, right?
Oh no! I am depressed now, right?
Oops...
Meow Meow!
